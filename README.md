## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- [Outfit font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - For fonts

### What I learned

With this project I learned a lot about about CSS such as custom fonts, centering div, box shadow and css variables. This project also helped me to reinforce what I've had previously known about the language.

This is also my first project where I've worked with Git and GitHub. This has helped me understand better how these technologies work by utilizing version control.
